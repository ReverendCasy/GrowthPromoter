# GrowthPromoter
A current repository for tracking down plant growth-promoting genes in the bacterial genomic data.

Most of the scripts used for data processing are stored in */scripts/* folder. A primer for operon integrity-tracking tool is uploaded separately under the name *checkOperonStructure.py*. For executable Python scripts, all the launching setings are accessible via command line help menu.
